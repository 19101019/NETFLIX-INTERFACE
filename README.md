# NETFLIX-INTERFACE
UI interaction :
The Netflix app home page features recommendations and genres, with side-scrolling thumbnails for various titles. The specifics of the interface vary slightly depending on which device you're streaming on, but they all follow a similar theme. The UI is pretty smooth in comparison to UI of Prime. This demo portal is just the similar interface carrying copy od dynamic page from Netflix .
